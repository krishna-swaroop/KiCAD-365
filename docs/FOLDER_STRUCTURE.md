# KiCAD-365 Hardware Repository Structure — KiCAD Projects

This document defines the **standard folder layout** for KiCAD-365’s hardware design repositories using **KiCAD**.  
It ensures that the tool properly categorizes and displays the projects in the intended manner

---

## Folder Overview

## Root Directory Contents

| File/Folder | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|
| `ProjectName.kicad_pro` | Main KiCAD project file |
| `ProjectName.kicad_sch` | Root schematic |
| `ProjectName.kicad_pcb` | PCB layout |
| `Outputs.kicad_jobset` | Job definition for GitHub Actions |
| `README.md` | Overview and documentation hub |
| `.gitignore` | Version control exclusions |
| `.github/` | CI/CD workflows and templates |

> These are the only files that should appear in the root directory of this repo. Tweak your `.gitignore` file if your PC is generating any other caches, backups etc.

---

### `assets/`
Supporting visual and data files for documentation and simulation outputs.

**Use this for:**
- Store a rendered image of the board titled thumbnail_*.png for the tool to display in the project gallery view
- Renders, screenshots, and photos  
- Simulation plots and result files  
- Images embedded in other markdown documents (Markdown referencing has some bugs) 

---

### `docs/`
Markdown-based documentation that tracks the lifecycle of the board and provide inputs for teams working with these boards.

**Typical contents:**
- Interface Control Documents (ICDs)  
- Software Requirement Specifications (SRS)  
- Board Datasheets  
- Bring-up and test guides  
- Test logs and validation results 

---

### `Subsheets/`
Contains **all child schematic pages** (`.kicad_sch`) except the root schematic.  
Keeps the top-level clean and allows KiCAD to resolve hierarchical paths properly.

> Note: Only Sheets spawned in the Root Schematic need to be created with Subsheets/xyx.kicad_sch filename. Please avoid creating multiple instances of Subsheets inside this. I will personally hunt you down and hold you captive until you fix your schematic if there are multiple instances on your repo.  

---

### `packages3D/`
Houses STEP models generated by the **Archive 3D Models Plugin**.

- This is an autogenerated folder. Assign your 3D Models based on where you store your local copy of the STEP Files and run the plugin
- Files follow `${KIPRJMOD}/packages3D/` relative paths.  
- This folder should contain the **final 3D geometry** for all components used on the board.

> The tool doesn't display this folder by default. But you can send custom curl requests to the backend API to access these files

---

### `simulation/`
A sandbox for all simulation-related work.

**Can include:**
- SPICE or ngspice setup files  
- `.cir`, `.net`, or `.sp` files  
- Output data (plots, waveforms, CSV exports)

> Go wild with this. More sims the better. LTSpice, QSpice, LTPowerCAD etc.

## Output Directories (Generated via GitHub Actions)

When `Outputs.kicad_jobset` is triggered in CI, it automatically creates two directories:  

> The Jobset file will autogenerate all the folders for you. However, you will have to change the file names inside the jobset configuration. By default, the jobset will output OBC as the `BoardName`. 
  
* I am exploring tweaking the jobset file to use a Variable called BoardName that you can set inside KiCAD when you start a project.
---

### `Design-Outputs/`
Files generated for **quick reference, design reviews** and internal engineering use.

| File/Folder | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `BoardName.pdf` | Full schematic PDF |
| `BoardName.csv` | BoM for design team review |
| `BoardName_iBoM.html` | Interactive BoM (manual generation for now) |
| `BoardName.net` | Electrical netlist |
| `3DModel/BoardName.step` | PCB 3D model STEP file |
| `Layout/BoardName.pdf` | Single PDF with all layout layers |

---

### `Manufacturing-Outputs/`
Files for **fabrication, procurement, and assembly** teams.

| Folder/File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `3DModel/BoardName.step` | Final PCB 3D model |
| `BOM/BoardName.csv` | Manufacturing BoM |
| `BOM/BoardName_iBoM.html` | Interactive BoM |
| `Gerbers/` | Gerber + drill files and PDF maps |
| `BoardName-odb.zip` | ODB++ archive |
| `BoardName-Gerbers.zip` | Standard Gerber ZIP |
| `Layout/BoardName.pdf` | Layout layers combined PDF |
| `Schematic/BoardName.pdf` | Schematic PDF |
| `XY-Data/BoardName-top` | Top pick-and-place |
| `XY-Data/BoardName-bottom` | Bottom pick-and-place |

> This is for my own personal CI/CD pipeline. You can ignore this. You can place anything you would categorize as Design-Outputs/ or Manufacturing-Outputs/ inside their respective folders. The tool accesses Design-Outputs/ and Manufacturing-Outputs/ folders for displaying the files in the side navigation tabs.
