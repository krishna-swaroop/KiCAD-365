## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for KiCAD-365.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

This effort has majorly been vibe-coded by me over a sleepless weekend to solve a gripe I've had while working with a team of people on KiCAD projects. I've found the Live Server features of the "CAD that shan't be named" to actually be useful for reviewing and collaborating on PCB Designs. And this is a small effort to bridge the gap.

### Enhancements and the Road Ahead

The low-hanging fruit has been addressed. The next steps are to add a functioning 3D viewer using WebGL. As a novice to world of Web Development, it will be baby steps from my end. Any and all help will be appreciated.

After the 3D viewer is in place, the next big thing to tackle is the ability to add comments to the various files in the project. This will be a significant undertaking as KiCanvas explicitly states that they do NOT plan on supporting any form of editing of the files in the browser.

I am sure a lot of people would want Authentication Features to be added to the platform. My intention with this project was to provide a platform that small teams could host on their local workstations. This will be on the backburner from my end (or atleast my tokens won't be going towards this in the near future :)) )
